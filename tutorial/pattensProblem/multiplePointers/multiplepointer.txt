Creating Pointers that correspond to index and move to end,middle or start ,based on certain conditions.
# efficient for handling problems with minimal space complexity.
#applications 
1. substring that meet ceretain condition e.g unique values, sum upto zero, duplicates.

#example
1.Write a function called sumZero that accepts a sorted array.
Finds first pair that sums to zero.
Then returns array of values summing to zero or undefined if pair does not exist.

cases
sumZero([-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3] )//[-3,3]
sumZero([ -2,0,1,3])// undefined
//study 
sumZero([-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,5])
pointerLeft=-4
pointerRight =5
   move pointerRigt to left else, move pointer to right.
