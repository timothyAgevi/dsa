Creatiung Pointers thAT correspond to index and move to end,beggining or start ,based on certain conditions.



#example
1.Write a function called sumZero that accepts a sorted array.
Finds first pair that sums to zero.
Then returns array of values summing to zero or undefined if pair does not exist.

cases
sumZero([-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3] )//[-3,3]
sumZero([ -2,0,1,3])// undefined
//study 
sumZero([-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,5])
pointerLeft=-4
pointerRight =5
   movve pointerRigt to left else, move pointer to right.
