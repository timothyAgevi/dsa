 -used for tracking/finding  subset of data in array/string that satisfy given condition.

note: sliding window concerned with data btn 2 pointers, while multiple pointers just concerned with data at the 2 pointers.

window can be array or number from one position to another.
-depending on condition window either incerese
 or closes(and new window is created i).

 e.g. 
 write a functio maxSubarraySum that accepts an array of integers and a number called n.
 the function should calculate the  maxium sum of n consecutive elements in array.

 ##pseudocode 
 1.define tempSum, maxSum
 2.check if arrr larger than n ,return null
 3.loop index from 0 ,upto n, and increment each times
   4.let maxSum += arr[i];
  5. let tempSum =maxSum;
  6.loop from i=num, i<arr.length;i++) 
    //let tempSum =tempSum - arr[i-num] +arr[i]
    //7.maxSum = math.max(tempSum,maxSum)
